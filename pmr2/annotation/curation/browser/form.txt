Curation Overview
=================

The curation module provides site managers the ability to curate (grade)
the contents within the sites using curation flags.  Curation flags are
essentially tags with values that can be selected, with an optional
method to determine the value to assign to the item to be curated.

As users generally do not write code that can be executed on the server
(for the automated curation to happen), specialized modules will provide
the automatic curation flags.  For those, the reviewer would check the
applicable flags to assign to the item, then the curation process would
select the intended value to apply to that item for that flag.

The other part allows manual curation, where the reviewer would use the
curation flags defined by the site managers to apply to the curated
items.  This may prove to be the more common usage.

We should already have a curation utility defined already, which can be
queried like so:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from pmr2.annotation.curation.interfaces import ICurationTool
    >>> tool = getUtility(ICurationTool)
    >>> tool
    <pmr2.annotation.curation.tool.CurationToolAnnotation ...>
